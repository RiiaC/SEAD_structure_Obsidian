> [!info] Column I. Reservoir offset, or R(t)
> This is the difference in ¹⁴C (radiocarbon) content between the analysed sample and a specific carbon reservoir (like the ocean, a lake, or groundwater) and the atmosphere, making samples from these areas appear artificially older. This value is used when calculating the calibrated ages (reported in columns [[K. from 1σ|K.]], [[L. to 1σ|L.]], [[M.from 2σ|M.]], and [[N.]]) from the raw radiocarbon date ([[F. BP|F.]]).
