This folder contains information pertaining to the ongoing mapping of the Radiocarbon data set to the SEAD database structure. The mapping is being undertaken in a spreadsheet called radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx, and this folder contains one file for each of the columns in the  first tab (**a1_radiocarbon_data tab**) of that spreadsheet. 

>[!info] Click on each of the links to the the individual columns to get a description of the data in that column, and how it is mapped to SEAD using the many other sheets in the spreadsheet.
