---
>[!info] This folder contains information pertaining to the ongoing mapping of the Radiocarbon data set to the SEAD database structure. 

The mapping is being undertaken in a spreadsheet called radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx, and this folder contains one file for each of the columns in the  first tab (**a1_radiocarbon_data tab**) of that spreadsheet. 

Here follows a list of the tables to which these columns have been mapped, so far, with links to their mapping notes:

- [[0. Datset#datasets]]
- [[0. Datset#dataset masters]]
- [[0. Datset#contacts]]
- [[B. Element#abundance elements]]
- [[B. Element#abundances]]
- [[B. Element#analysis entities]]
- [[D. Site#sites]] 
- [[D. Site#locations]]
- [[D. Site#site locations]]
- 


>[!tips] Click on each of the links to the the individual columns
to get a description of the data in that column, and how (if) it is (yet) mapped to SEAD in the form of links to many other sheets in the spreadsheet.
