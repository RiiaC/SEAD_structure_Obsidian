>[!info]  This is the Radiocarbon dataset associated with the paper Glykou et.al 2021 (see below for full citation.)
>It comes to us in the form of the first sheet of the file [radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx spreadsheet]([radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx](https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/SEAD72/Shared%20Documents/Task%20force%20-%20System%20analysis%20of%20radiocarbon%20data/Datasets/AFL/input-data/radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx?d=w34fa6e11a37c4afe9398f92ea68bd11c&csf=1&web=1&e=LaDqOd)) . The other notes in this folder describe the mapping of the columns of that sheet to the SEAD database.

In addition to mapping the rest of the data, it is necessary to define the dataset itself in SEAD.

 - [ ] create and fill in a sheet called **datasets** in the [radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx spreadsheet]([radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx](https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/SEAD72/Shared%20Documents/Task%20force%20-%20System%20analysis%20of%20radiocarbon%20data/Datasets/AFL/input-data/radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx?d=w34fa6e11a37c4afe9398f92ea68bd11c&csf=1&web=1&e=LaDqOd)) with the following columns
 - **system_id** because this is a single dataset, this sheet will contain only one row, with a value of 1 in this column.
 - **[[biblio_id]]** copy this information from the **system_id** numbers of the biblio sheet of this spreadsheet (see the note for column **O. Source**). (*This value will be 1, because the paper that generated the data for the dataset should be the first one listed in the list of references associated with the data.*)
 - **[[data_type_id]]** Enter in this column the appropriate SEAD code for this type of data. Perhaps, type 8, which is for "Continuous" data, which is described as "*A measured quantity*".
 - **[[dataset_name]]** Give the dataset an appropriate name, in this case "Radioarbon (Glykou 2021)".
 - **[[master_set_id]]** Copy the value from the **system_id** number for the **dataset masters** sheet described below. *Note that as this is the first dataset from the collected datasets submitted together, this has the value of 1.* 
 - **[[method_id]]** enter the appropriate SEAD code for the method used in this dataset. Since this is a radiocarbon data set, perhaps it is 156 = Calibrated radiocarbon date (method unspecified), or perhaps it is 157 = Calibrated AMS radiocarbon date. *Consult with the data provider to choose appropriately, or, if needed, create a new one.*
 - **[[project_id]]** *Consult with the SEAD team to determine if a new project id needs to be created for this data set, or if this column can be left empty.*
 - **[[dataset_id]]** If this had been a dataset that was previously entered into SEAD, its official dataset_id would be entered here. However, since it has not, the system_id for this sheet will be used to create one when the data is imported.

>[!warning] finish filling in this page from here

>[!info]  A dataset comes from a specific research group, laboratory, or department. Therefore we also need a sheet to specify the source of the dataset.
- [ ]  create and fill in a sheet called **dataset masters** in the [radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx spreadsheet]([radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx](https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/SEAD72/Shared%20Documents/Task%20force%20-%20System%20analysis%20of%20radiocarbon%20data/Datasets/AFL/input-data/radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx?d=w34fa6e11a37c4afe9398f92ea68bd11c&csf=1&web=1&e=LaDqOd)) with the following columns
- **system_id** This column is filled incrementally, starting with 1 and is used during the import process to keep track of the data in this sheet, and to cross-reference its connections to the other sheets.
- **[[master_name]]** 
- **[[master_notes]]**
- **[[biblio_id]]**
- **[[contact_id]]	
- **[[url]]**
- **[[master_set_id]]**
