![[Radiocarbon data column O.png]]

- [ ] create and fill in a sheet called **biblio** in the [radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx](%5Bradiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx%5D(https://umeauniversity.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/SEAD72/Shared%20Documents/Task%20force%20-%20System%20analysis%20of%20radiocarbon%20data/Datasets/AFL/input-data/radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx?d=w34fa6e11a37c4afe9398f92ea68bd11c&csf=1&web=1&e=LaDqOd)) spreadsheet with the following columns
- **system_id** This column is filled incrementally, starting with 1 and is used during the import process to keep track of the data in this sheet, and to cross-reference its connections to the other sheets.
- [[authors]] *(fill this information in from the bibliography of the paper(s) provided with the dataset)*
- [[year]] *(fill this information in from the bibliography of the paper(s) provided with the dataset)*
- [[title]] *(fill this information in from the bibliography of the paper(s) provided with the dataset)*
- [[full_reference]] *(fill this information in from the bibliography of the paper(s) provided with the dataset)*
- [[doi]] *(fill this information in, if present, from the bibliography of the paper(s) provided with the dataset)*
- [[isbn]] *(fill this information in, if present, from the bibliography of the paper(s) provided with the dataset)*
- [[notes]] *(fill this information in, if present, from the bibliography of the paper(s) provided with the dataset)*
- [[url]] *(fill this information in, if present, from the bibliography of the paper(s) provided with the dataset)*
- [[biblio_id]] fill this in for any references that already exist in SEAD, using the [[biblio_id]] number on record.

> [!info] Each of the above publications are associated with one or more sites, once information is entered into the above sheet, it is time to link them (the "relational" part of the database)

- [ ] create and fill in a sheet called **site references** which contains the following columns:
- **system_id** This column is filled incrementally, starting with 1 and is used during the import process to keep track of the data in this sheet, and to cross-reference its connections to the other sheets.
- **[[site_id]]** copy this information from the **system_id** numbers of the **sites** sheet (even if a given site already has a SEAD [site_id](app://obsidian.md/site_id)). (_If it helps to keep track of which ones have been done, you can also add a column to show the corresponding **site_name** on this sheet, but it is not needed for the import process, this column is enough to connect the information for the relational part of the database._)
- **[[biblio_id]]** copy this information from the **system_id** numbers of the **biblio** sheet (even if a given site already has a SEAD [site_id](app://obsidian.md/site_id)). (_If it helps to keep track of which ones have been done, you can also add a column to show the corresponding [[site_name]] on this sheet, but it is not needed for the import process, this column is enough to connect the information for the relational part of the database._)
- **[[site_reference_id]]** <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">(I am not certain what this one is for)</span>
