> [!info] Specifies the types of quantification methods used in datasets, including definitions of each classification system.

The below list of data types is sorted by groups, as defined by the **data_type_group_id**

# Continuous data types

|data_type_id||data_type_name|definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|8||Continuous|A measured quantity.|
|46||Mixed-method dependent|Multiple datatypes from one method. (e.g. multiple isotope types from masspectrometry)|
# Discrete data types
|data_type_id||data_type_name|definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|5||Abundance|The absolute number of the counted element (e.g. seeds fossils) present in the sample.|
|9||MNI|Minimum Number of Individual organisms as calculated from recorded parts (e.g. whole insect equivalents)|
# Classification data types
|data_type_id||data_type_name|definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|19||Categorical|Data classified according to a set of predefined categories (e.g. temperature classes|
# Presence only
|data_type_id||data_type_name|definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|6||Presence|The element/fossil is present in the sample but not quantified (numerical classification where 1 = presence)|
# Relative scale data types
|data_type_id||data_type_name|definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|7||Spot test interpretation|The relative intensity of a spot test result on a three grade scale: 12 3 where 3 is the highest.|
|20||Percentage|Data expressed as a percentage (i.e. out x of 100)|
# Composite scale data types

|data_type_id||data_type_name|definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|10||Partial abundance|A legacy data type used in BugsCEP to represent partially quantified and incomplete lists e.g. quantified up to 50 individuals and then estimated.|
|13||Undefined other|Data type is not clearly defined could be a combination of quantification presence/absence and semi-quantification or qualification. Beware of using data of this type for quantification.|
|18||Categorical & Scaled (0-5|Mix of data specified on a scale of 0 to 5 where 0 is absence and 5 is maximum amount of property and data classified on the presence of a property (e.g. Granite = tempering by granite present)|
# Chronological data types
|data_type_id||data_type_name|definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|14||Uncalibrated dates|Sample ages in uncalibrated values consisting of mean and error (+/-). Requires calibration to compare with calendar years.|
|15||Counted dates|Sample ages derived from counted rings layers or dated events.|
|16||Calendar dates|sample ages calibrated to calendar dates|
# Geographical data types
|data_type_id||data_type_name|definition|
|---|---|---|---|
|43||Estimated Years|Dates that are an estimation|
|44||Composite date|A date which may include other information than the age such as season terminus and/or error margin.|
|45||Approximate location|Geographical location given as approximate values or text. May include multiple levels text strings and exclusions (e.g. not Poland).|
