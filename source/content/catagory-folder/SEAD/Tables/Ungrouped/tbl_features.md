Represents archaeological features, which are immovable traces of past human activities. These features include structures or landscape modifications such as building remains, hearths, burials, pits, roads, terraces, and defensive constructions like mounds and ditches. They are vital for understanding the spatial organization, cultural practices, and daily life of ancient societies, providing context for interpreting artifacts and environmental interactions. Archaeological features are analyzed in situ through excavation and surveying to offer insights into historical human-environment dynamics.
