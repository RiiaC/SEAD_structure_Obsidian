# Welcome to my blog
After years of using Dreamwidth, and before that LiveJournal, I am in the process of moving myself here. Why? Because I fell in love with the note taking program, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) last year and have transitioned everything there. When I found out that it is possible to turn an Obsidian vault into a web page, I decided to give it a try.

So far (2025-12-02) this contains only 2025's blog posts and unpublished notes for days that never made it to [my Dreamwidth page](https://kareina.dreamwidth.org/), but I plan to go back and import the older ones, eventually. In the meantime, anyone who is curious can head over there to look.

I will, after I learn how, be adding a table of contents etc, but in the short term, you can use the graph view to navigate by zooming in clicking on entries there.
