title: SEAD Structure

# Welcome to the Obsidian Vault illustrating SEAD's Database Structure
>[!info] This web page provides a graphical representation of the structure of the SEAD database, with a note for every table and column in the database itself with links showing which columns are part of what tables.

In addition, there is another set of notes for mapping the Radiocarbon dataset in preparation for importation into SEAD. These notes are still in progress, but serve as a record of how the mapping is progressing, and thus will be available later for training others in the process of mapping a new dataset to SEAD.

Thus far the notes describing [[D. Site]] and [[O. Source]] are complete and linked to all of relevant SEAD tables and columns.
