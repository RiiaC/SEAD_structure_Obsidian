This folder created 2025-09-22. The plan is to create notes for the various data types in the input data files from the **Task force - System analysis of radiocarbon data > Datasets > AFL > input-data** folder on teams.

# the file **radiocarbon_Glykou_etal_2021_input.xlsx**
The first tab (**a1_radiocarbon_data tab**) contains the following columns (each of which has their own notes, on which I can create links to matching data in SEAD):
- [[A. Map Fig.1]]
- [[B. Element]] 
- [[C. Biological Age]]
- [[D. Site]]
- [[E. Lab nr]]
- [[F. BP]]
- [[G. ±]]
- [[H. δ13C]]
- [[I. R(t)]]
- [[J. ±]]
- [[K. from 1σ]]
- [[L. to 1σ]]
- [[M.from 2σ]]
- [[N.to 2σ]]
- [[O. Source]]
It also contains a "**Column1"**, which contains a single entry: *"Skip K-M if there is data in F & G"*
