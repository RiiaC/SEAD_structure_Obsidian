> [!info] Element
> Describes a physical sample upon which analysis was performed, in terms of body part (e.g. Femur, Mandibula, Humerus, etc.). 

- This is similar to [[tbl_abundance_elements]], which defines the type of element, part, or unit being counted, and that definition also can be a list of body parts. However, **Element** is an sample which was analysed, and not counted, so that is not necessarily a good match.
